# Family Office Philanthropic Planning Guide

## What is Philanthropic Planning?

Philanthropic planning is the strategic approach to charitable giving that aligns a family's values, wealth management objectives, and desired social impact. For family offices, it involves creating a structured framework that optimizes giving while balancing:

1. **Family needs** - ensuring sufficient wealth for future generations
2. **Charitable impact** - maximizing the effectiveness of philanthropic capital
3. **Legacy considerations** - preserving family values and engagement across generations

This Monte Carlo simulation tool helps model various philanthropic strategies across multiple scenarios to identify optimal approaches for your family's unique situation.

- **Key Metrics Dashboard**: Summarizes critical performance indicators

## Common Scenarios and Strategies

### Balancing Family and Philanthropy

For those prioritizing both family financial security and philanthropic impact:

- Start with a lower philanthropic allocation (15-25%)
- Use a more conservative withdrawal rate (3-4%)
- Consider donor-advised funds for flexibility

### Creating Multi-generational Impact

For those focused on long-term legacy:

- Implement a mix of vehicles with private foundation as core
- Keep withdrawal rate at or below 4%
- Focus on successor engagement strategies

### Maximizing Near-term Impact

For those wanting to see impact during their lifetime:

- Consider higher withdrawal rates (5-7%)
- Utilize direct giving alongside structured vehicles
- Focus on measurable outcomes in specific cause areas

## Best Practices

1. **Revisit annually**: Philanthropic strategy should be reviewed yearly
2. **Involve next generation early**: Build engagement through participation
3. **Measure impact**: Define clear metrics for philanthropic outcomes
4. **Align investments**: Consider mission-aligned investing alongside grantmaking
5. **Balance structure and flexibility**: Maintain room to respond to emerging needs

By thoughtfully configuring this simulation, you can develop a philanthropic strategy that creates meaningful impact while honoring your family's values and financial needs.
